# Single-objective-Swarm-optimization
Optimization algorithm for single objective functions using a hybrid of Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing as proposed in the publication by: 

Deepak Joshi, Satyabrata Dash, Ujjawal Agarwal, Ratnajit Bhattacharjee and Gaurav Trivedi, "Analog Circuit Optimization Based on Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization", International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI 2015), Las Vegas, USA.

The code hpso_singleObj.py optimizes the test function "Sphere function" and can be replaced with any of the other test functions for single-objective optimization.
